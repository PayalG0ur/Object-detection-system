# Object-detection-system
This project helps the visualy disacbled to detect object and notifies them of the obstacle ahead. 
This project was created by me and my friend as trial to create better gear for the visualy impaired/disabbled persons. 
The original idea was to create a shoe prototype that can detect obstacles from  a distance and send a signall to the person wearing them and help them avoid the obstacle. 

# Disclaimer: 
The project is still incomplete. This here is just the test version simulation of the project. An ultrasonic sensor is used to detect the object along with a buzzer to notify the presense of obstacle and a 16x2 LCD screen to display the distance of the object. 

# Components 
 1. Arduino Uno
 2. HC-RS04 ultrasonic sensor
 3. Buzzer
 4. LCD Screen
 5. Resistors (based on requirments)
 6. Connecting wires
 7. Bread Board
